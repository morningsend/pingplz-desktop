#PingPlz - App for Serious Gamers

We understand the frustration of laggy game play which is why we are creating this application.
Server latency can be checked with running the ping utility on the terminal, but PingPlz makes
it easy to simultaneously monitor a number of game servers for you. 

Features:
 - Support for most popular games: WoW, SC2, LOL, RL, CS:GO, many many more.
 - Simultaneously monitors multiple servers
 - Configure your own game or server settings
 - Slick UI
 - Support for both Linux/Mac/Windows.
